This script will download all the session material for you if you are a WWDC 2010 attendee.
You'll need ruby and the mechanize and json ruby gems. You can install them like this:

sudo gem install mechanize json

You simply run the script like this: 
ruby wwdc2010downloader.rb <your Apple ID> <your ADC Password>

The script will create a directory called "wwdc2010-assets" in the directory you run the script from.

That's it. Enjoy and see you next year.
